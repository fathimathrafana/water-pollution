 **WATER POLLUTION DETECTION PROJECT ðŸ’§ðŸ”¬**

 **OVERVIEW**
Water pollution is a growing global challenge, affecting health, ecosystems, and access to clean drinking water.  
This project uses Deep Learning to classify water images into two categories: **Clean Water** and **Dirty Water**.  
The goal is to support early detection of contaminated water sources, enable quick response, and promote safer water usage.
